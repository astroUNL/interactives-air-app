There are/were two issues affecting these three ranking tasks.

Kepler 1 has been fixed. See the commit message for de54433...9922 (2020-01-22) for
details of the problems and their solutions.

Kepler 2 and 3 should have the same fixes applied. However, the FLAs currently in this
repository are out-of-date (they have incorrect background pages).
